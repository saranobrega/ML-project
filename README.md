# Machine_Learning-project



The dataset to be analysed is PetFinder_dataset.csv, made avaliable together with this project description. 
This dataset, downloaded from Kaggle, contains selected data from the following competition: PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction.

PetFinder.my has been Malaysiaâ€™s leading animal welfare platform since 2008, with a database of more than 150,000 animals.
PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare. 
Animal adoption rates are strongly correlated to the metadata associated with their online profiles, such as descriptive text and photo characteristics. 
As one example, PetFinder is currently experimenting with a simple AI tool called the Cuteness Meter, which ranks how cute a pet is based on qualities present in their photos.
In this competition data scientist are supposed to develop algorithms to predict the adoptability of pets - specifically, how quickly is a pet adopted? 
If successful, they will be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and rescuers around the world on improving their pet profiles' appeal, reducing animal suffering and euthanization.

In this project, your team is supposed to use only tabular data (not Images or Image Metadata) and see how far you can go in predicting and understanging PetFinder.my adoptions. 
You should use both supervised and unsupervised learning to tackled 2 tasks:


Task 1 (Supervised Learning) - Predicting Adoption and Adoption Speed
Task 2 (Unsupervised Learning) - Charactering Adopted Pets and Adoption Speed

The PetFinder_dataset.csv you should learn from has 14.993 instances described by 24 data fields that you might use as categorical/numerical features and
matches the train.csv file made available for the competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data). 
The target in the original Kaggle challenge is Adoption Speed.
