# Machine Learning Project - MSc in Physics


The dataset to be analysed is PetFinder_dataset.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data). In this competition data scientists are supposed to develop algorithms to predict the adoptability of pets - specifically, how quickly is a pet adopted? 

If successful, they will be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and rescuers around the world on improving their pet profiles' appeal, reducing animal suffering and euthanization

PetFinder.my has been Malaysiaâ€™s leading animal welfare platform since 2008, with a database of more than 150,000 animals.
PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare. 
Animal adoption rates are strongly correlated to the metadata associated with their online profiles, such as descriptive text and photo characteristics. 

In this project, the team is supposed to use only tabular data (not Images or Image Metadata) and see how far you can go in predicting and understanging PetFinder.my adoptions using  both supervised and unsupervised learning to tackled 2 tasks:


- Task 1 (Supervised Learning) - Predicting Adoption and Adoption Speed

- Task 2 (Unsupervised Learning) - Charactering Adopted Pets and Adoption Speed

The PetFinder_dataset.csv  has 14.993 instances described by 24 data fields that might be uses as categorical/numerical features and
matches the train.csv file made available for the competition.
